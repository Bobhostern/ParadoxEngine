This is the Paradox Engine, an attempt to make an extensible RPG Engine with support for custom graphics systems.
Status: Version 0.01 (incomplete)

I do development on a Linux, so I apologize to any Windows users. Once I get mingw working, I will probably make a binary for Windows.

Refer to INFO.md for more information.
